## Overview
OceanWATERS is a physical and visual simulation of a lander on Europa. It is intended as a
testbed to aid in producing software that could fly on lander missions to ocean
worlds, such as Europa and Enceladus.

## Code Organization

This repository just adds build scripts and other miscellaneous files. OceanWATERS are associated with this repo as git submodules:
- [irg_open](https://github.com/nasa/irg_open)
- [ow_simulator](https://github.com/nasa/ow_simulator)
- [ow_autonomy](https://github.com/nasa/ow_autonomy)
- [ow_europa](https://github.com/nasa/ow_europa)

## Getting Started

* [Running the fully baked OceanWATERS docker images](#running-the-fully-baked-oceanwaters-docker-images)
* [Running the base OceanWATERS docker image for development](#running-the-base-oceanwaters-docker-image-for-development)
* [Instantiate more than one terminal to the same OceanWATERS container instance](#instantiate-more-than-one-terminal-to-the-same-oceanwaters-container-instance)

### Running the fully baked OceanWATERS docker images
If you are merely interested in running the simulation you can do so by running one of the fully baked OceanWATERS docker images:
  - stable channel: `oceanwaters/oceanwaters`         
  - development channel: `oceanwaters/oceanwaters_nightly` 

To run using the base gpu accelerated docker (nvidia) use the following command:
```bash
docker run -it --gpus all -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix \
    -e DISPLAY -e XAUTHORITY -e NVIDIA_DRIVER_CAPABILITIES=all \
    oceanwaters/oceanwaters:ros-melodic-desktop-full-nvidia
```
By default this would automatically launch the simulation, you can override the default behaviour by specifying the command
to be run as follows:

```bash
docker run --gpus all -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix \
    -e DISPLAY -e XAUTHORITY -e NVIDIA_DRIVER_CAPABILITIES=all \
    oceanwaters/oceanwaters:ros-melodic-desktop-full-nvidia /bin/bash
```
then once you connect to the docker container you may launch the simulation using:
```bash
roslaunch ow atacama_y1a.launch # or you may use europa_terminator_workspace.launch
```

### Running the base OceanWATERS docker image for development
If you are interested in doing development on the docker image you can use the builder images:
  - stable channel: `oceanwaters/builder`
  - development channel: `oceanwaters/builder_nightly`

The development image doesn't contain the code baked into it, but it has all the required dependencies to build and run
the project regardless of the user current - linux-based - host system.  
So assuming that the oceanwaters workspace is located at `~/oceanwaters_ws` then you can mount the folder into
the docker container as follows:

```bash
docker run -it --rm \
    -v ~/oceanwaters_ws:/oceanwaters_ws \
    -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix \
    --gpus all -e DISPLAY -e XAUTHORITY -e NVIDIA_DRIVER_CAPABILITIES=all \
    oceanwaters/builder_nightly:ros-melodic-desktop-full-nvidia
```
Once conntected to the container, you can then build the project as follows:
```bash
cd /oceanwaters_ws  # navigate to the oceanwaters workspace
catkin build        # build the project
```
### Instantiate more than one terminal to the same OceanWATERS container instance
Sometimes you may need to submit commands to connect another terminal to a given OceanWATERS container. 

```bash
docker ps # lists currently running containers in your system
# note down the name or id of the running OceanWATERS container that you want to access from a different terminal
docker exec -it <ow-container-name> /bin/bash # you can supply the container id instead
cd /oceanwaters_ws  # navigate to the oceanwaters workspace
source /ow_env/setup.bash   # source ROS enviroment
source devel/setup.bash     # source your workspace again
# Now you can execute a ROS command to a running instance of the simulation
# for example try: rostopic list
```
