## Getting Started
TODO

### Running OceanWATERS docker images

Launch OceanWATERS using the base docker image:
```bash
docker run -it oceanwaters/oceanwaters:ros-melodic-desktop-full
```

>Note: TODO Add steps to run the simulator

To run using the base gpu accelerated docker (nvidia) use the following command:
```bash
docker run --gpus all -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix \
    -e DISPLAY -e XAUTHORITY -e NVIDIA_DRIVER_CAPABILITIES=all \
    oceanwaters/oceanwaters:ros-melodic-desktop-full-nvidia
```
